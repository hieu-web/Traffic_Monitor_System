A computer vision-based application designed to detect, track, and monitor vehicle traffic flow in real-time.

## 📌 Features
* **Vehicle Detection**: Real-time identification of cars, motorbikes, buses, and trucks.
* **Traffic Analysis**: Process video data for traffic flow insights.
* **Optimized Models**: Uses high-performance weights for accurate detection.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `app.py`: The main Python execution file for the system.
* `models/`: Folder containing pre-trained model weights (e.g., `best.pt`).
